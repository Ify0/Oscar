<i>Moonlight</i> is a 2016 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Barry Jenkins, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unpublished semi-autobiographical play <i>In 
Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue</i>. It stars Trevante Rhodes, Andr&eacute; Holland, Janelle Mon&aacute;e, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali.
<p></p>
The film presents three stages in the life of the main character. It explores the difficulties he faces with his sexuality and identity, including the physical and emotional abuse 
he endures growing up. Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. Distributed by A24, the film was released 
in the United States on October 21, 2016, and grossed over $65 million worldwide against a $4 million budget.
<p></p>
Moonlight received universal acclaim upon its release. At the 74th Golden Globe Awards it won Best Motion Picture – Drama and was nominated in five other categories. The film won the 
Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Supporting Actor for Ali and Best Adapted Screenplay for Jenkins and McCraney, from a total of eight nominations. In 2017, The New 
York Times considered it the twentieth "Best Film of the 21st Century So Far".

Moonlight became the first film with an all-black cast, the first LGBT film, and the second lowest-grossing film domestically (behind <i>The Hurt Locker</i>) to win the Oscar for 
Best Picture. The film's editor, Joi McMillon, became the first black woman to be nominated for an editing Oscar (alongside co-editor Nat Sanders), and Ali became the first Muslim 
to win an acting Oscar.
