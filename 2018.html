<i>Green Book</i> is a 2018 American biographical comedy-drama buddy film directed by Peter Farrelly. Set in 1962, the film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep 
South by African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga who served as Shirley's driver and bodyguard. The film 
was written by Farrelly, Brian Hayes Currie and Vallelonga's son, Nick Vallelonga, based on interviews with his father and Shirley, as well as letters his father wrote to his 
mother. The film is named after <i>The Negro Motorist Green Book</i>, a mid-20th century guidebook for African-American travelers written by Victor Hugo Green.
<p></p>
<i>Green Book</i> had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2018, where it won the People's Choice Award. It was then theatrically released in 
the United States on November 16, 2018, by Universal Pictures, and grossed $321 million worldwide. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Viggo Mortensen 
and Mahershala Ali's performances, although it also drew some criticism of its depiction of both race and Shirley.
<p></p>
<i>Green Book</i> received numerous accolades and nominations. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, at the 91st Academy Awards, in addition to winning Best Original Screenplay 
and Best Supporting Actor for Ali. The film also won the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – 
Musical or Comedy, the National Board of Review award for the best film of 2018, and was chosen as one of the top 10 films of the year by the American Film Institute. Ali also 
won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA awards for Best Supporting Actor.
