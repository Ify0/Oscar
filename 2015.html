<i>Spotlight</i> is a 2015 American biographical crime drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's 
"Spotlight" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and 
systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the "Spotlight" team that earned The Globe the 
2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, 
and Billy Crudup.

Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special 
Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[10] The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films and grossed $90 million 
worldwide. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. Spotlight won the Academy 
Award for Best Picture along with Best Original Screenplay from six nominations in total, making Spotlight the first film from Open Road Films to win in either category. 
This also marks the first film to win Best Picture from a different mini-major studio than Lionsgate, Summit Entertainment (later bought by Lionsgate in 2012), Miramax, 
or The Weinstein Company.
