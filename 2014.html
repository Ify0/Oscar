<i>Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)</i>, commonly known as <i>Birdman</i>, is a 2014 American satirical black comedy-drama film directed by Alejandro G. 
I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu. It was written by I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, Nicol&aacute;s Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo. The film stars Michael Keaton with a 
supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood 
actor best known for playing the superhero "Birdman", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver.

The film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu had from the film's 
conception. Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in <i>Birdman</i>, believed that the recording time necessary for the unique long take approach 
taken in <i>Birdman</i> could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly 
financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International 
Film Festival.

<i>Birdman</i> had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. 
The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with <i>The 
Grand Budapest Hotel</i> for the most nominated film of the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors 
Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.
